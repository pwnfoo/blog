Hey there. If it was not evident from my landing page, I am Sachin S Kamath. To begin with, I am 19 years old and do a lot more than an engineering student should be doing in his/her age. I take pride in saying I am a gamer, cyber-security enthusiast and a keen follower of FOSS, all of which is "self-proclaimed".

I am that person who believes nothing is impossible provided there is time, dedication and passion to work towards it. Talking about the technical aspects of me, I prefer Linux anyday over Windows and can debate on this topic for hours (Howdy, Windows fans :P ). That being said, I do not deny the fact that nothing beats a Windows in the aspect of GPU support.
Windows - 1
Linux - 99


Apart from this, I love to break stuff. If there is a nice little shiny computer sitting next to me, I will do all that I can to tamper with it and find out why it's shining so much afterall. That reminds me of this beautiful ranting :
> Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for - Mentor

In this blog, you can expect to find a log of all my technical and rarely, non-technical work. I will try to keep this blog active. Oh, Did I tell you I am just an amateur blogger? That means, I am very open to suggestions and will reply to almost all of the suggestions/criticism you inbox me.
