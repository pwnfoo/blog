This summer, I am super excited to announce that I am participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) for the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org). As Google describes it :

*Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.*

This year, I will be working with the awesome [CommOps Team](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps) to improve their exisitng Toolbox. My project proposal can be found [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_2016/Student_Application_skamath). Fedora is not a new to me. I have been contributing to Fedora, both actively and passively for around 2 years now. To be specific, I have contributed to the [Glittergallery project](https://github.com/glittergallery/GlitterGallery) and have delivered a couple of talks on contributing to Fedora, the details of which can be found [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Skamath)

I would like to thank [decause](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:decause) who is my mentor for this project, the awesome peeps at CommOps (special shout-out to [jflory7](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jflory) and  [linuxmodder](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:linuxmodder) for helping me get started and [bee2502](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:bee2502) for the first Karma Badge :)

Right now, it is the community bonding period and I am getting more involved with the CommOps team in understanding the place better. I am also getting familiar with the [CommOps Toolbox](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps#Toolbox) on which I will be hacking on.

Expect more posts as I make progress. Till then, Goodbye and stay silly :)
